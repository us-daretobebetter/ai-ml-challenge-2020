1030,5. Confidentiality.
1031,"Confidential Information. ""Confidential Information"" of a party means all information of that party (a ""Discloser"") relating to or disclosed to the other party (a ""Recipient"") by or on behalf of the Discloser during the Term which is or should be reasonably understood by the Recipient to be confidential or proprietary to the Discloser, including, but not limited to, the Software, technical processes and formulas, source codes and other software, product designs, sales, cost and other unpublished financial information, product and business plans, projections, and marketing data. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) was known to the Recipient before receipt from Discloser; (ii) is obtained by the Recipient from any third person not owing any confidentiality obligation to the Discloser; (iii) is or becomes generally known in the trade through no act or omission of the Recipient; or (iv) is independently developed by the Recipient or Recipient's employees who have not had direct or indirect access to Discloser's Confidential Information. Recipient will bear the burden of establishing any of these exclusions. Only the specific information that meets the exclusions will be excluded, and not any other information that happens to appear in proximity to the excluded portions (for example, a portion of a document may be excluded without affecting the confidential nature of those portions that do not themselves qualify for exclusion)."
1032,"Permitted Use. Confidential Information of each party will be used by the other party solely for the purposes permitted by this Agreement. All Confidential Information will be received and held in confidence by the receiving party, subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that it will not obtain any rights of any sort in or to the Confidential Information of the other party as a result of such disclosure and that any such rights must be the subject of separate written agreement(s).."
1033,"Required Disclosures. Nothing herein shall prevent either party from disclosing all or part of the Confidential Information of the other as necessary pursuant to the lawful requirement of a governmental agency or when disclosure is required by operation of law; provided that prior to any such disclosure, a Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to (i) promptly notify the Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose Recipient may comply with any such court order or other legal requirement, but any information so disclosed shall continue to be treated as Confidential Information hereunder.  128 Technology recognizes that Federal agencies are subject to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, which requires that certain information be released, despite being characterized as ""confidential"" by the vendor."

The indemnitee has the right to participate at its own expense in the claim or suit and in selecting counsel therefor.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed in derogation of the U.S. Department of Justice's right to defend any claim or action brought against the U.S., pursuant to its jurisdictional statute 28 U.S.C. §516."

It shall be Customer's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations."
