COMPANY does not make any warranty that the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free.

Licensor and the Government will each (i) secure and protect the other party's Confidential Information by using the same or greater level of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of like kind, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care, and (ii) advise each of their respective employees, agents, attorneys and independent contractors who have access to such Confidential Information to hold it confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may disclose the other party's Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, including without limitation any applicable Freedom of Information Act or sunshine law, or by order of a court or other governmental entity, in which case such party will so notify the other party as soon as practicable and if possible at least thirty (30) days prior to such party making such required disclosure."

COMPANY shall coordinate its defense with the Department of Justice as requested by Client. In addition to"
1050,"COMPANY' obligation of indemnification, if the Services become or, in COMPANY' opinion, are likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement, COMPANY may, at its option, either procure for Client the right to continue using the Services or replace or modify the Services to make the Services non-infringing. If COMPANY, in its sole discretion, concludes that neither of these alternatives is reasonably available, COMPANY may terminate Client's right to use the Services and release Client from its obligation to make future payments for the Services or issue a pro rata refund for any fees paid in advance.

1087,"""Severity 1"" - Services is inoperable. Client is unable to use the Services without significant disruption to Customer's primary business operations and with respect to which no workarounds exist that would enable the Services to be so used until corrections can be made."
1088,"""Severity 2"" - issue that is of a severity that prevents the Services from being used without significant disruption to Client's primary business operations but with respect to which a workaround exists enabling business operations even if in a diminished capacity."

1096,COMPANY and Client may revise the Severity classification of the issue based on additional information provided by Client or uncovered during the resolution process.
1097,"Issue Resolution. COMPANY' response and resolution targets are set forth in the table on the following page. However, resolution times will vary depending on the exact issue and customer environment."
1098,"1	Target time frames are measured from creation of a case number per the process described above. Since Defects may not be resolvable within a specific timeframe due to complexity of the solution and other factors, resolution targets are goals and not commitments. The use of the terms ""hours"" and ""days"" refer to ""business hours"" and ""business days,"" are based on COMPANY' regular business schedule, and exclude weekends and COMPANY locally-observed holidays."
1099,2	Support requests submitted by email are automatically classified as a Severity 4 Defect.

1104,"COMPANY endeavors to investigate and correct issues at COMPANY' offices. If COMPANY is unable to do so, and provided the suspected issue is not attributable, in whole or in part, to any of the excluded causes specified below, then upon Client's request, COMPANY may travel to Client's location to investigate the issue with travel and other out-of-pocket expenses included as part of Maintenance Services. If, after COMPANY travels to the Client location, the suspected issue is determined to be unrelated to the Services, the problem resolution will be Client's responsibility and Client agrees to pay any travel expenses in accordance with Federal Travel Regulation (FTR)/Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), as applicable. Client shall only be liable for such travel expenses as approved as by Ordering Activity and funded under the applicable ordering document.
