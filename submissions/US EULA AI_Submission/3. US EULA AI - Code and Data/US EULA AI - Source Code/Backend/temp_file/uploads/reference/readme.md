# Reference Information Available For Challenge

The following items are available for reference by teams submitting solutions to the AI/ML challenge.


* [AI_ML Challenge Scoring Rubric](AI_ML%20Challenge%20Scoring%20Rubric.pdf) - This document demonstrates the scoring methodology that will be used to evaluate submissions.

* [Appendix B - Unacceptable Clauses](appendix_b_unacceptable_clauses.pdf) - This document contains examples of clauses that are not acceptable for End User License Agreements for GSA purposes.

* [sample_eula_1.docx](sample_eula_1.docx) - A sample of a EULA in MS Word format. This is the type of source document that the solution should be able to process. 

* [sample_eula_2.docx](sample_eula_2.docx) - A sample of a EULA in MS Word format. This is the type of source document that the solution should be able to process.

* [sample_eula_1.pdf](sample_eula_1.pdf) - A sample of a EULA in PDF. This is the type of source document that the solution should be able to process. 

* [sample_eula_2.pdf](sample_eula_2.pdf) - A sample of a EULA in PDF. This is the type of source document that the solution should be able to process.

* [train.pkl](train.pkl) - Binary file containing training data used by the [Solicitation Review Tool (SRT) machine learning application](https://github.com/GSA/srt-fbo-scraper). Although not directly related to EULAs, this may be useful as additional training data using Transfer Learning. Teams will be awarded points for using transfer learning methods to improve their model.
