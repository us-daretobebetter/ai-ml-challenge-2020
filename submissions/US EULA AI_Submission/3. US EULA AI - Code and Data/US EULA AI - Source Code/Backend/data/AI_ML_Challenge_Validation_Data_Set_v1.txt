This type of deployment generally provides better scalability, reliability, and efficient use of resources than a single server deployment. The infrastructure details of this type of deployment are outside the scope of this document, but can be summarized as follows:
· A load balancer provides a single point of entry for all inbound application traffic. The load balancer distributes all web service requests to the web tier according to various load-balancing algorithms.
· The web tier serves up static application assets (HTML pages, Flash content, CSS, etc.) and proxies web service requests to the application tier. The web tier consists of one or more clustered web nodes (servers) running PRODUCT HTTP Server. The web tier is deployed across multiple subnets attached to Internet gateways for public accessibility through restricted server ports (80 and 443).
· The application tier contains and executes the web service code, which interacts with the database tier for data access. The application tier consists of one or more clustered app nodes running PRODUCT Application Server. The application tier is deployed across multiple private subnets (no Internet gateway), restricting access to web servers only.
· The database tier stores and replicates all application data. The database tier consists of a master database node and one or more slave database nodes for redundancy. The database tier is deployed across multiple private subnets (no Internet gateway), restricting access to application servers only."

a. Grant of License. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, underlying GSA Schedule Contract and applicable Order Confirmation, COMPANY grants Ordering Activity a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use Software for Internal Purposes at Ordering Activity’s site(s) only, but only in accordance with (a) the Documentation, (b) this Agreement and (c) the License Level. For the purposes of this Section, Software shall also include any Documentation and any Updates provided to Ordering Activity under this Agreement. For Software that will be used in a service provider role, the terms of Article IV shall apply; licenses not identified as “Service Provider” licenses on an Order Confirmation may not be used in a service provider capacity and shall be governed by this Article III. Distribution of installation programs of non-Ordering Activity products shall require a service provider license as governed by the terms of Article IV below.
b. License Models. Ordering Activity may be licensed pursuant to one of the following license models, which will be identified on the applicable Order Confirmation.
i. Node-Locked Licenses. If Ordering Activity has licensed Software on a node-locked basis, Ordering Activity may install and use one instance of the Software on a single computer either physically installed or on a virtual image on that computer only at Ordering Activity’s site(s) for Ordering Activity’s Internal Purposes only in accordance with the License Level. A node-locked license is limited to use by a single User on a single computer or virtual image; Ordering Activity may not install the Software on a shared computer. Copying a virtual image for the purposes of using the image either simultaneously or as a replacement on another machine is strictly prohibited.
ii. Concurrent Licenses. If Ordering Activity has licensed on a concurrent basis, Ordering Activity may install the Software on any machine at
Ordering Activity’s site(s) for Ordering Activity’s Internal Purposes only in accordance with the License Level. All machines using the Software must have the ability to communicate with a license server to be authorized to use the Software. For the purpose of certification as set forth in the Agreement, the number of concurrent Users is the highest number of Users that accessed the Software at any single point during the previous year.
c. Standalone Build Licenses: In addition to the use rights for the Software, Standalone Build Licenses may also be run on a separate Build System but only if run by automated processes or by a User. If Ordering Activity has licensed the PRODUCT, Ordering Activity may install and use one copy of the Software on a single computer residing on Ordering Activity’s premises only for Ordering Activity’s Internal Purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                        
d. Upgrades. Upgrades, if provided to Ordering Activity, may be licensed to Ordering Activity by COMPANY. Upgrades may be used only by the User of the original version of the Software that is being upgraded. After installation of an Upgrade, such User may continue to use the prior version(s) of the Software in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such version, provided that (i) the prior version(s) may only be used by the same User of the Upgrade; (ii) Ordering Activity acknowledges that any obligation COMPANY may have to support the prior version(s) may be ended upon the availability of the Upgrade.
e. Dual-Media Software. Ordering Activity may receive the Software in more than one medium (electronic and on a DVD, for example). Receipt of the Software in more than a single manner (electronic or on a DVD, for example) does not expand the license rights granted to Ordering Activity hereunder. Ordering Activity’s use of the Software is limited to the number of licenses (instances) that Ordering Activity has acquired overall, regardless of number or type of media on which it has been provided.
f. Transfers. Transfers of licenses that are the result of employee turnover or reassignment are allowed, provided that such transfers do not occur more frequently than annually."

Company will provide ongoing maintenance and support services for Products as detailed below and address any Error in accordance with Section 5 (Error Severity Levels). In order to ensure consistent administration of support across its operations, Customer must elect either (i) Company Basic, or (ii) Company Advanced for all of its Products, whether existing or newly acquired.  Any modification or amendment necessary to harmonize Customer’s Company service level across all of Customer’s Products shall be evidenced in writing and executed by an authorized representative for both parties.  Company will invoice Customer for any additional Company fees to increase the Company service level for its Products, provided, however, that Customer shall not be entitled to receive, and Company shall have no obligation to provide, any refund, credit or other consideration in the event Customer elects to reduce its Company services level from Company Advanced to Company Basic.  For purposes of clarity, Customer may not simultaneously receive Company Basic for certain Products and Company Advanced for other Products.  All services provided under Company shall be conducted in the English language. Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the services set forth in this Section 4 during Regular Hours for Company Basic or Premier Hours for Company Advanced, as applicable.
Company Support
Customer shall have direct access to Company’s support team (“Company Support”) through a list of persons designated by Customer in writing (“Authorized Contact Persons”). If Customer needs to add additional names to its Authorized Contact Persons list, Customer must notify Company in advance, and the parties shall mutually determine an arrangement. Such Authorized Contact Persons must have adequate technical expertise or otherwise be trained in administering or managing the Products to assist Company Support in troubleshooting Errors. All inquiries to Company Support must be made by an Authorized Contact Person and Company will have no obligation to accept calls directly from, or otherwise interact directly with personnel other than an Authorized Contact Person. 
For Company Basic, Company Support will respond to Customer during Regular Hours within the Severity Level Response Times. For Company Advanced, Company Support will respond to Customer during Premier Hours within the Severity Level Response Times. Severity Level Response Times and contact methods are provided in Exhibit A (Technical Support and Escalation Process).
Software Updates
Customer shall receive software releases or updates that Company, in its discretion, makes generally available without additional charge. 
Use of certain Modules may require Customer to purchase additional Products and/or third party products which are not provided to Customer under Company. In addition, Customer shall pay any Third-Party Sublicensing Fee(s), if any, required for use of a Module.  A “Third-Party Sublicensing Fee” means any licensing fee required by a third party to allow the Module or other Software to interoperate with products or functionality provided by such third party.
Company will make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate Customer’s requests for modifications to the Software; however, Company is under no obligation to incorporate those requests in future releases of any Software.
In the event that Customer’s Company Term has expired or is otherwise no longer valid, and Customer downloads and uses Modules, Service Packs, or other Software releases or updates that Company makes generally available under Company, Company will invoice Customer for the then-current list price (unless otherwise agreed) for one (1) year of Company fees. 
Advanced Hardware Replacement
Company will provide Hardware replacement for a defective Product in advance of Customer’s return of the defective Product, provided that Customer immediately notifies Company in writing of such defect and requests a Return Material Authorization (“RMA”).  If Company approves the return request and issues the RMA, (a) for shipments to U.S. locations under Company Basic, Company will deliver the replacement Hardware within five (5) business days from Company’s issuance of the RMA; (b) for shipments to U.S. locations under Company Advanced, Company will deliver the replacement Hardware within two (2) business days from Company’s issuance of the RMA. Company cannot guarantee delivery times for shipments outside the U.S. as transportation issues, alternative routing, and customs clearance may delay delivery.
Customer shall pack the Hardware to protect it from damage while in transit and ship the defective Hardware to Company, with the RMA number clearly displayed on the exterior of the package. 
If, after attempting to repair the Hardware, Company finds no Error in the Hardware, Company reserves the right to charge Customer a reasonable replacement charge. 
If Company does not receive the defective Hardware incorporating all original swappable components delivered by Company, including, without limitation, hard drives, power supply and small form factor pluggables (SFPs), within thirty (30) days of Company’s issuance of the RMA, Company will invoice Customer a replacement fee equal to the then-current list price (unless otherwise agreed) of the applicable Product.
