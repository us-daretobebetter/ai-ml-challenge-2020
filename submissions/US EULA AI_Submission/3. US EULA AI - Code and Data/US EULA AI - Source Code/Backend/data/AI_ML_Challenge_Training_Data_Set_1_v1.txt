If Customer purchases a Resident Support Account Manager (“RSAM”) or Resident Product Specialist (“RPS”), Company will provide an RSAM or RPS to provide on-site certain Support that Customer has purchased from Company. Additional information on the description and scope of the RSAM’s and RPS’s roles and responsibilities can be found at http://support.Company.com/documentation.
The RSAM or RPS will work during normal business hours as agreed upon between Company and Customer. The RSAM or RPS may be required to be out-of-the-office due to PTO, illness, holidays, training, vacations or meetings. During this time out-of-the-office, or should the RSAM’s or RPS’s employment with Company end, Company will provide to Customer the name and phone number of a temporary Support Account Manager (“SAM”) that will
cover Customer’s account until the RSAM or RPS returns. The temporary SAM will provide Support services remotely.
Customer acknowledges and understands that the timeline to on-board at Customer’s location is approximately ninety (90) days from the time of the notification of the requirement. During this period, Company will assign an interim SAM to facilitate the Support services until the parties can agree upon the individual to be placed as an RSAM or RPS. Company and Customer will work together in good faith to select the RSAM or RPS. In the event Customer rejects the candidate or delays in the selection of a reasonable candidate Company has offered for consideration, Company will assign an interim SAM. For avoidance of doubt, the interim SAM will not be an on-site resource and may be a shared resource with other Company customers.
Customer acknowledges that Company employees are quickly deployed, and any delay in the selection of a candidate may: (1) result in Customer not being able to have its desired individual perform the Support services;
(2) result in the use of an interim SAM (as stated above); and (3) hinder the performance of the Support services as described herein. Customer also acknowledges that it might not be possible to retain a particular individual for the duration of the term of the Support Period. The use of an interim SAM is, on its own, not sufficient to warrant a refund of fees or entitle customer to service credits.

“Service Interruption” means, except for scheduled system maintenance, the period of time that a Platform is either (a) not available for Ordering Activity log-in or (b) substantially not functioning. API Interruptions and other circumstances beyond our control shall not constitute Service Interruptions.

6915,"Ratings
Company ratings scores for the alternatives are acquired by multiplying scores on individual criteria by the weights assigned to those criteria, and then summing the total. Ratings on individual criteria are placed on a 0 to 1 scale by using rating scales. In a verbal scale, a given verbal rating corresponds to a score between 0 and 1; that numeric score then enters the calculation. With a numeric scale, a user can input as many pairs of a numeric score and the corresponding score between 0 and 1 as is desired; for a given input, the score will be based on the linear relationship of those pairs. For example, consider a scale in which a score of 50 receives a 0 and a score of 100 receives a 1. To determine which COMPANY score to assign to a 75, find 75 on the line between the points (50,0) and (100,1). That occurs at (75, 0.5), so the COMPANY score is 0.5",0

If COMPANY ends the ordering document as specified in the preceding sentence, you must pay within 30 days all amounts which have accrued prior to such end, as well as all sums remaining unpaid for the services ordered under the agreement plus related taxes and expenses.  If COMPANY ends the services under the Indemnification section, you must pay within 30 days all amounts remaining unpaid for services plus related taxes and expenses.

User
(Four Categories)
A “User” for Company web products is defined as any individual person capable of sending HTTP requests to or from the Internet to be processed by a Company product, regardless of whether the individual is actively using the product at any given time. In such cases where multiple unique Users use the same workstation to
access the Internet, that workstation represents a single user.


A “User” for Company email products is defined as any  mail enabled account capable    of sending or receiving emails to or from the Internet to be processed by a Company product, regardless of whether the mailbox is actively using the product at any given time. This includes administrative mailboxes, for example, “do not reply”,
proxy, and customer service mailboxes.


For purposes of licensing compliance, an “Academic User” refers to the number of licenses required for Company academic-specific endpoint products licensed Per User. It is calculated as follows: Full-time faculty + Part-time faculty÷3 + Full-time staff + Part-time staff÷2 = Total number of licenses required. Students accessing
school-owned or leased computers do not need a license.


For  all  other  Company  Products,  a  “User”  is  defined  as  a  unique  individual  person within a company, organization, or other entity, where: (1) the entity has acquired a valid license(s) to use the product, and (2) the entity has authorized the particular individual person to use the product. For example, if the company has acquired 1,000 licenses of the product, and the company has authorized a particular individual to use the product, and that person falls within the aggregate pool of
people authorized to use the software, then they are a “User”, regardless of whether the individual is actively using the product at any given time.

If a third party makes a claim against either you or COMPANY (“Recipient” which may refer to you or COMPANY depending upon which party received the Material ), that any information, design, specification, instruction, software, service, data, or material (“Material”) furnished by either you or COMPANY (“Provider” which may refer to you or COMPANY depending on which party provided the Material), and used by the Recipient infringes its intellectual property rights, the Provider, at its sole cost and expense, will defend the Recipient against the claim and indemnify the Recipient from the damages, liabilities, costs and expenses awarded by the court to the third party claiming infringement or the settlement agreed to by the Provider, if the Recipient does the following:  
 •        notifies the Provider promptly in writing, not later than 30 days after the Recipient receives notice of the claim (or sooner if required by applicable law); 
•        gives the Provider sole control of the defense and any settlement negotiations; and  
•        gives the Provider the information, authority, and assistance the Provider needs to defend against or settle the claim.   
 If the Provider believes or it is determined that any of the Material may have violated a third party’s intellectual property rights, the Provider may choose to either modify the Material to be non-infringing (while substantially preserving its utility or functionality) or obtain a license to allow for continued use, or if these alternatives are not commercially reasonable, the Provider may end the license for, and require return of, the applicable Material and refund any unused, prepaid fees the Recipient may have paid to the other party for such Material.  If such return materially affects COMPANY’s ability to meet its obligations under the relevant order, then COMPANY may, at its option and upon 30 days prior written notice, terminate the order.  The Provider will not indemnify the Recipient if the Recipient alters the Material or uses it outside the scope of use identified in the Provider’s user documentation or services policies or if the Recipient uses a version of the Materials which has been superseded, if the infringement claim could have been avoided by using an unaltered current version of the Material which was provided to the Recipient.  The Provider will not indemnify the Recipient to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon (i) any information, design, specification, instruction, software, data, or material not furnished by the Provider, or (ii) any Material from a third party portal or other external source that is accessible to you within or from the service (e.g., a third party Web page accessed via a hyperlink).  COMPANY will not indemnify you to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon the combination of any Material with any products or services not provided by COMPANY.  AVATAR will not indemnify you for infringement caused by your actions against any third party if the services as delivered to you and used in accordance with the terms of the agreement would not otherwise infringe any third party intellectual property rights.

Buyer agrees to inform all users of Products, that COMPANYshall not be liable for any lack of privacy or security resulting from use of the Products. Products are based on cellular technology which may become obsolete in the future as a result of changes in wireless technology or actions by telecom regulators with respect to cellular technology in mapping applications.

“Confidential Information” means non-public information, technical data or know-how of a party and/or its affiliates, which is furnished to the other party in written or tangible form in connection with this Agreement. Oral disclosure will also be deemed Confidential Information if it would reasonably be considered to be of a confidential nature or if it is confirmed at the time of disclosure to be confidential.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information which is: (i) already in the possession of the receiving party and not subject to a confidentiality obligation to the providing party; (ii) independently developed by the receiving party;
(iii) publicly disclosed through no fault of the receiving party; (iv) rightfully received by the receiving party from a third party that is not under any obligation to keep such information confidential; (v) approved for release by written agreement with the disclosing party; or (vi) disclosed pursuant to the requirements of law, regulation, or court order, provided that the receiving party will promptly inform the providing party of any such requirement and cooperate with any attempt to procure a protective order or similar treatment. Vendor recognizes that Federal agencies are subject to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, which requires that certain information be released, despite being characterized as “confidential” by the vendor.

Neither party will use the other party’s Confidential Information except as reasonably required for the performance of this Agreement. Each party will hold in confidence the other party’s Confidential Information by means that are no less restrictive than those used for its own confidential materials. Each party agrees not to disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to anyone other than its employees or subcontractors who are bound by confidentiality obligations and who need to know the same to perform such party’s obligations hereunder. The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section will survive for one (1) years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, except as otherwise agreed in writing or otherwise stated in this Agreement, each party will, upon the request of the disclosing party, either: (i) return all of such Confidential Information of the disclosing party and all copies thereof in the receiving party’s possession or control to the disclosing party; or (ii) destroy all Confidential Information and all copies thereof in the receiving party’s possession or control. The receiving party will then, at the request of the disclosing party, certify in writing that no copies have been retained by the receiving party, its employees or agents.

In case a party receives legal process that demands or requires disclosure of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, such party will give prompt notice to the disclosing party, if legally permissible, to enable the disclosing party to challenge such demand.

If you would like to associate your Corporate Account with a company name, we will do our best to confirm that association based on the information you provide to us. The more information you provide, the better able we will be to confirm that association. Information that helps us confirm a company's association with an account includes: the name of the business included at the time of acceptance of these Terms, the payment information, and the email addresses associated with the account. In the event that you do not provide sufficient information for us to confirm your company's association with the account, association will be determined by the email addresses and security settings within your account settings.
You must create an individual account before you can create a Corporate Account. We have a few simple rules for individual accounts on Company:
You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by ""bots"" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.
One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
""You may not create an account for the use of any User under the age of 13. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. Company does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate
     that User’s account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.""

Monthly Uptime Percentage        Service Credits
< 99.9% - >= 99.0%        3 days

“Service Credits” means the calendar days of service to be added to the end of your then-current one-year Service term at no additional charge to you in the event the 99.9% Monthly Uptime Percentage target is not met.  Service Credits only expand the duration of your existing subscription to Services by the stated number of days and do not expand the scope of, or features included within, the Services.

In the event of a termination, Customer’s payment obligations will include the following (collectively, “Termination Charges”): (i) all accrued but unpaid charges (including both recurring and non-recurring charges) accrued but unpaid through the last day of the calendar month in which the termination is exercised; (ii) the aggregate termination charges (if any) imposed in connection with the termination by any access providers., and (iii) if the Agreement is terminated during the Initial Term or Renewal Term, Early Termination Charges.  Early Termination Charges include a) charges for the difference between the paid MRC for the Service(s) and the then prevailing month-to-month retail rates for the applicable Service(s) for the months or portions thereof the Service(s) were received prior to early termination, and b) charges for the remaining months in the term at the then prevailing month-to-month retail rates for the applicable Service(s) for all Sites, multiplied by the number of months, or portion thereof, remaining in the then-current term, and any other applicable termination-related charges or Site Termination Charges specified in this Agreement.  The Parties agree that the Early Termination Charges and/or Site Termination Charges are intended to constitute liquidated damages to the Company and will not be deemed to constitute a forfeiture or penalty.  Due to the special nature of this transaction, the parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of a contract termination or a Site termination, (i) it will be impractical or extremely difficult to determine damages suffered by the Company, (ii) Customer wishes to have a limitation placed upon its potential liability to the Company for termination or Site termination, and (iii) the Early Termination Charges and/or Site Termination Charge (as applicable) represent a reasonable estimate of damages which the Company will sustain in such an event.

The existence of unfavorable conditions, such as weather and wave interference from distant stations can interrupt Product functionality. Moreover, if a Product is moved out of an available service area, communication with that Product will be unavailable until it returns to the available service area. Other environmental issues including, but not limited to service interruptions, poor coverage areas, network congestion, roaming and other wireless access issues may affect Product performance. Global Positioning System (“GPS”) is a satellite based positioning technology providing expansive coverage throughout the world. However, the GPS antenna in a Product must have a radio frequency link to the GPS satellites. If such radio frequency link is impaired, the Product may be unable to correctly recognize its location.

To the extent any Attachment A Terms are inconsistent with Federal law (See, FAR 12.212(a)), such inconsistent terms shall be superseded, unenforceable and of no legal force or effect in all resultant orders under the Schedule Contract, including but not limited to the following provisions: Contracting Parties. The GSA  Customer (“Licensee”) is the “Ordering Activity”, defined as the entity authorized to order under GSA MAS contracts as set forth in  GSA Order OGP 4800.2I, as may be revised from time to time.Changes to Work and Delays. Subject to GSAR Clause 552.243-72, Modifications (Federal Supply Schedule) (July 2000) (Deviation I – SEPT 2010), and 52.212-4(f) Excusable Delays (JUN 2010) regarding which the GSAR and the FAR provisions take precedence.

Contract Formation. Subject to FAR 1.601(a) and FAR 43.102, the GSA Customer Purchase Order must be signed by a duly warranted Contracting Officer, in writing. The same requirement applies to contract modifications affecting the rights of the parties.  All terms and conditions intended to bind the Government must be included within the contract signed by the Government.  

Termination.  Clauses in the Manufacturer Specific Terms referencing termination or cancellation are superseded and not applicable to any GSA Customer order. Termination shall be governed by the FAR, the underlying GSA Schedule Contract and the terms in any applicable GSA Customer Purchase Orders. If the Contractor believes the GSA Customer to be in breach, it must file a claim with the Contracting Officer and continue to diligently pursue performance. In commercial item contracting under FAR 12.302(b), the FAR provisions dealing with disputes and continued performance cannot be changed by the Contracting Officer.

Choice of Law. Subject to the Contracts Disputes Act, the validity, interpretation and enforcement of this Rider shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Country.  In the event the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any similar fFederal laws or regulations are enacted, to the extent allowed by federal law, they will not apply to this Rider or the underlying Schedule Contract.
  
Equitable remedies.  Equitable remedies are generally not awarded against the Government absent a statute providing therefore. In the absence of a direct citation to such a statute, all clauses in the Manufacturer Specific Terms referencing equitable remedies are superseded and not applicable to any GSA Customer order.

Unilateral Termination. Unilateral termination by the Contractor does not apply to a GSA Customer Purchase Order and all clauses in the Manufacturer Specific Terms referencing unilateral termination rights of the Manufacturer are hereby superseded.   

 Unreasonable Delay. Subject to FAR 52.212-4(f) Excusable delays, the Contractor shall be liable for default unless the nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

Assignment. All clauses regarding the Contractor’s assignment are subject to FAR 52.232-23, Assignment of Claims (JAN 1986) and FAR 42.12 Novation and Change-of-Name Agreements (Sep. 2013).  All clauses governing the Contractor’s assignment in the Manufacturer Specific Terms are hereby superseded. 

Waiver of Jury Trial.  Waivers of Jury Trials are subject to FAR 52.233-1 Disputes (JULY 2002). The Government will not agree to waive any right that it may have under federal law. All clauses governing a waiver of jury trial in the Manufacturer Specific Terms are hereby superseded.

Government Indemnities.  This is an obligation in advance of an appropriation that violates anti-deficiency laws (31 U.S.C. § 1341 and 41 U.S.C. § 6301), since the GSA Customer commits to pay an unknown amount at an unknown future time.  The violation occurs when the commitment is made, i.e., when the agreement featuring this clause is incorporated into a Government contract, and not when the clause is triggered.  The Interim FAR Rule dated June 21, 2013 and the Office of Legal Counsel opinion dated March 12, 2012 prohibit such indemnifications.  All Manufacturer Specific Terms referencing customer indemnities are hereby superseded.

Contractor Indemnities.  All Manufacturer Specific Terms that violate DOJ’s jurisdictional statute (28 U.S.C. § 516) by requiring that the Government give sole control over the litigation and/or settlement to the Contractor are hereby superseded. Nothing contained in the Manufacturer’s Specific terms shall be construed in derogation of the U.S. Department of Justice’s right to defend any claim or action brought against the U.S., pursuant to its jurisdictional statute.

Renewals.  All Manufacturer Specific Terms that provide for automatic renewals violate the Anti-Deficiency Act and are hereby superseded. This is an obligation in advance of an appropriation that violates anti-deficiency laws (31 U.S.C. § 1341 and 41 U.S.C. § 6301), since the GSA Customer commits to pay an unknown amount at an unknown future time.  The violation occurs when the commitment is made, i.e., when the agreement featuring this clause is incorporated into a Government contract, and not when the clause is triggered.

Future Fees or Penalties.  All Manufacturer Specific Terms that  require the Government to pay any future fees, charges or penalties  are hereby superseded unless specifically authorized by existing statutes, such as the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. § 3901 et seq.) or Equal Access To Justice Act (5 U.S.C. § 504; 28 U.S.C. § 2412).

Taxes. Taxes are subject to FAR 52.212-4(k), which provides that the contract price includes all applicable federal, state, local taxes and duties. Contractor shall state separately on its invoices, taxes excluded from the fees, and the GSA Customer agrees to either pay the amount of the taxes (based on the current value of the equipment or services) to Contractor or provide it evidence necessary to sustain an exemption, in accordance with FAR 52.229-1 and FAR 52.229-3.

Third Party Terms. When the end user is an instrumentality of the U.S., no license terms bind the GSA Customer unless included verbatim (not by reference) in the EULA, and the EULA is made an attachment to the underlying GSA Schedule Contract. All terms and conditions affecting the GSA Customer must be contained in a writing signed by a duly warranted Contracting Officer.  Any third party manufacturer shall be brought into the negotiation, or the components acquired separately under federally-compatible agreements, if any.  All Manufacturer Specific Terms that incorporate third party terms by reference are hereby superseded.   

Dispute Resolution and Standing.   Any disputes relating to the Manufacturer Specific Terms or to this Rider shall be resolved in accordance with the FAR, the underlying GSA Schedule Contract, any applicable GSA Customer Purchase Orders, and the Contract Disputes Act. The Ordering Activity expressly acknowledges that COMPANY as contractor, on behalf of the Manufacturer, shall have standing to bring such claim under the Contract Disputes Act.

Advertisements and Endorsements.  Pursuant to GSAR 552.203-71, use of the name or logo of any U.S. Government entity is prohibited. All Manufacturer Specific Terms that allow the Contractor to use the name or logo of a Government entity are hereby superseded.

Public Access to Information.  COMPANY agrees that the attached Manufacturer Specific Terms and this Rider contain no confidential or proprietary information and acknowledges the Rider shall be available to the public.

Confidentiality.  Any provisions in the attached Manufacturer Specific Terms that require the Ordering Activity to keep certain information confidential are subject to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552), and any order by a Country Federal Court. When the end user is an instrumentality of the U.S. Government, neither this Rider, the Manufacturer’s Specific Terms nor the Schedule Price List shall be deemed “confidential information” notwithstanding marking to that effect. Notwithstanding anything in this Rider, the Manufacturer’s Specific Terms or the Schedule Contract to the contrary, the GSA Customer may retain such Confidential Information as required by law, regulation or its bonafide document retention procedures for legal, regulatory or compliance purposes; provided however, that such retained Confidential Information will continue to be subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Rider, the Manufacturer’s Specific Terms and the Schedule Contract.

Alternate Dispute Resolution. The GSA Customer cannot be forced to mediate or arbitrate. Arbitration requires prior guidance by the head of a federal agency promulgated via administrative rulemaking according to 5 U.S.C. § 575(c). GSA has not issued any because it considers the Board of Contract Appeals to be an adequate, binding ADR alternative. All Manufacturer Specific Terms that allow the Contractor to choose arbitration, mediation or other forms of alternate dispute resolution are hereby superseded.

Ownership of Derivative Works. Provisions purporting to vest exclusive ownership of all derivative works in the licensor of the standard software on which such works may be based are superseded. Ownership of derivative works should be as set forth in the copyright statute, 17 U.S.C. § 103 and the FAR clause at 52.227-14, but at a minimum, the GSA Customer shall receive unlimited rights to use such derivative works at no further cost.

6723,"Preventative Maintenance.
a. “Preventative Maintenance” includes installation of patches, bug fixes, upgrades to the operating system, hardware, and/or firmware upgrades, and any other measures that COMPANY deems necessary to ensure the proper functioning and security of its data center and Hosted Software, in its sole and exclusive discretion.
b. Licensee acknowledges that COMPANY shall have the exclusive right to schedule and implement Preventative Maintenance measures, including those resulting in system and application downtime, rendering the Hosted Software temporarily inaccessible (“Scheduled Downtime”).

d. Updates and patches to the operating system and Hosted Software will be tested for performance and stability issues in a secure environment before they are implemented on behalf of the Licensee. Virtualized test instances are made available to the Licensee for patching, upgrades, and troubleshooting on an as-needed basis in COMPANY’ sole and exclusive discretion.
e. COMPANY will maintain a log that identifies: (i) the date and time of Preventative Maintenance; (ii) the individual performing the Preventative Maintenance; (iii) the individual who provided access to the data center and Services if other than the individual performing the Preventative Maintenance; (iv) the Preventative Maintenance performed; and (v) any equipment removed or replaced during Preventative Maintenance.",0

4331,"d.  ARBITRATION PROCEDURES.  Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.  Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.  If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.  The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.  Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Agreement and applicable law.  Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.


Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.  If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.  If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Company agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
