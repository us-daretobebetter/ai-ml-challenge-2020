# GSA - EULA Challenge

This is the frontend (web application) for the EULA challenge, build in Angular.

## Host the app locally

- Run `npm i` to install all the required packages.

- Change the returned value in /src/app/services/data.service.ts getHost() from `/api` to `http://localhost:3002`, to call locally hosted python backend.

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
